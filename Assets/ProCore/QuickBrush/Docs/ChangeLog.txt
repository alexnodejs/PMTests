v1.1.1e
Compatibility: Removed API calls obsolete in unity 5.

v1.1.1d
New Feature: A new scale setting was added allowing scaling to be applied as an absolute value or as a multiplier applied to the scale saved in the prefab being placed

Compatibility: Updated for Unity 5

v1.1.1c
Fixed Bug: qb_prefabObject class error in build - needs UnityEditor namespace. Moved all Editor only files to Editor folder to exclude them from stand alone builds.

v1.1.1b
Fixed Bug: Prefab check and remove buttons not working.

v 1.1.1
Fixed Bug: Painting failed when paint to layer is checked

New (mini) Feature: Clicking on a prefab preview now selects the prefab in the project view

Tweak: Brushes in the scene now display their tab number next to the brush radius ring for each active template. The brush for the selected template displays in blue while brushes for any other active templates display in grey
Tweak: Removed 'Scatter Amount' option because it was redundant and interfered with the new brush display setup
Tweak: Layer handling when using multiple templates together has been improved
Tweak: Prefab preview handling is improved to prevent cases when a preview would not show up immediately when a prefab is dropped in for the first time

v 1.1.0

New Feature: Multi-brush painting. Use multiple brushes simultaneously, each with its own settings.
New Feature: Added a master On/Off toggle which allows the user to free up the hotkeys used by qb without closing the tool window. (just click on the brush indicator icon to turn qb on/off)
New Feature: Tab Based Interface
New Feature: Prefab list display can be toggled between scrollable and grid mode
New Feature: qb now comes pre-compiled as a dll (release version only)
New Feature: Improved handling of tool closure - Templates are maintained between sessions without saving along with things like which prefab is selected, so when the tool is closed for a moment, it can be re-opened with all settings intact.
New Feature: Improved save system - among other improvements, qb notices attempts to override existing templates, and throws many useful dialogs for greater clarity of usage.
New Feature: Improved handling of groups - (groups are no longer stored by index, but can be recreated at paint time from stored names). Also Group erasing options are applied in a better way, allowing, for example, to erase only objects that belong to no groups
New Feature: Improved cursor with line to show surface normal
New Feature: Better graphic icons and icon states
New Feature: Log Messages for tab operations
New Feature: Added "Edit/Preferences" menu for qb (currently just to toggle Log Messages)

Fixed Bug: Interface Slow-down and Repainting has been fixed.
Fixed Bug: Secured against user created classes overlapping with UnityEditor.Tool calls inside of qb
Fixed Bug: Reset Defaults no longer reloads old settings when a tab is re-accessed by user
Fixed Bug: Fixed bug with object distribution across brush surface

Tweak: Changes have been made to how hotkeys are handled (this should keep qb from taking over the ctrl key when it shouldn't)
Tweak: Better layer testing in object placement pass.

PLUS: Many subtle workflow and performance tweaks
